# Project 2: Wall Bouncer

## Background
[Roomba](https://www.irobot.com/en_US/roomba.html) is a very popular housekeeping robot. 
Despite the new technologies introduced to recent products, the "navigation" strategy of this robot can be fairly simple. 
Inspired by the Roomba, we are going to develop a robot that navigates/bounces in a closed cell. 
A human robot interface (HRI) from first project will be also integrated. 

## Requirements:
> [!IMPORTANT]

### 2. (65%) Coding
- Program the Raspberry Pi Pico to: 
    - Encode robot's status into colors (`RED`, `GREEN`, `BLUE`) using LEDs .
    - Switch robot's behavior between `WORK MODE` and `PAUSE MODE` using a button.
    - **Read distance from ultrasonic sensor**.
    - **Send signals to motor driver board and move the robot according to the distance sensing**.
- Upload your script to this repository.
- Complete following tasks:
1. (3%) Initialization (System Check).
   - (2%) Blink all LEDs with frequency of 5 Hz, lasting 2 seconds when both conditions below are satisfied.
     - The button's GPIO pin is receiving correct default signal (`0` for `PULL_DOWN`, `1` for `PULL_UP`)
     - Ultrasonic sensor is receiving non-zero distance measuring.
   - (1%) The robot enters `PAUSE MODE` after this step.
2. (16%) When `PAUSE MODE` is activated:
   - (3%) `GREEN` LED fades in and fades out at frequency of 1 Hz (equally allocate fade-in and fade-out time).
   - (3%) Press the button to **immediately** switch to the `WORK MODE`.
   - (10%) Robot stop moving
3. (24%) When `WORK MODE` is activated:
   - (1%) `GREEN` LED stays constantly on.
   - (3%) Press the button to **immediately** switch to the **PAUSE MODE**.
   - (20%) Robot start moving without hitting the wall.
4. (20%) Low battery simulation.
   - (5%) If the accumulated `WORK MODE` time exceeds 45 seconds, substitute `GREEN` LED with **`BLUE`** LED for both modes (low-battery simulation).
   - (5%) If accumulated `WORK MODE` time over 55 seconds, blink `RED` LED at frequency of 10 Hz (`BLUE` and `GREEN` LED off).
   - (10%) If the accumulated `WORK MODE` time exceeds 45 seconds, Use 50% dutycycle of the original to be the robot's speed (Make sure the robot is still movable). 
5. (2%) Termination. Shutdown the system after the `RED` LED blinked 5 seconds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - It doesn't matter how your robot moves, but hitting a wall once during demonstration will cost 1% off your grade.
> - Plan a good strategy of wall avoidance.

> [!TIP]
> - Break tasks down into small pieces (the smaller the better). You may need write a handful of unit test scripts.
> - `print()` function and Python Shell are handy tools.

### 3. (35%) Documentation

#### 3.1. (15%) Mechanical Design: attach (multiple) technical drawings to illustrate dimensions and locations of the key components of the mobile base. 
- Denote dimensions of the bed.
- Denote dimensions and locations of the wheel assembly and the caster wheel.
- Denote locations of the mounting holes.
- Denote dimensions of the mounting holes.

  ![Bed Design](bedfordesign-Page.pdf)

> [!TIP]
> - You may want to checkout TechDraw of FreeCAD. Other CAD software should have the similar tools.  
> - Hand drawings are acceptable.

#### 3.2 (10%) Wiring Diagram: attach a drawing to illustrate electrical components' wiring.
- Specify power wires using red and black wires.
- Mark out employed signal pins' names.
- Electronic components' values have to match your actual circuit.

#### 3.3 (6%) Software Design
Use a [flowchart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart) or a [algorithm/pseudocode table](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms) or a [itemized list](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#lists) to explain your wall avoidance strategy.

Sensing the Environment:The robot reads the distance ($D$) from the ultrasonic sensor.

Decision: Is the distance $D$ less than the defined AVOIDANCE_DISTANCE_M (0.20 meters)?

Action Sequence (If Obstacle Detected: $D < 0.20$ m):

2.1. Immediate Stop: Halt all motor movement (dmd.stop()). This prevents contact or minimizes impact.

2.2. Back Up: Drive straight backward for a duration defined by BACKUP_TIME_S (0.5 seconds). This creates necessary clearance from the obstacle.

2.3. Stop Again: Halt all motor movement (dmd.stop()) to prepare for the turn.

2.4. Choose New Heading: Randomly select a turning direction (spin left or spin right). This randomization helps the robot escape corner traps.

2.5. Execute Turn: Run the chosen spin maneuver for a duration defined by TURN_TIME_S (0.4 seconds). This rotation changes the robot's heading away from the obstacle.

2.6. Final Stop: Halt all motor movement (dmd.stop()) after the turn is complete.

2.7. Resume Operation: The robot exits the avoidance block and returns to the main loop, where it immediately starts driving forward in the newly chosen direction.

Action Sequence (If Path is Clear: $D \ge 0.20$ m):The robot continues driving straight forward (dmd.linear_forward(current_speed)) at the calculated current_speed (which accounts for the low-battery reduction if applicable).

#### 3.4 (4%) Energy Efficient Path Planning 
> The goal is using this robot to cover a rectangle-shape area.
> Do your research, make reasonable assumptions and propose a path pattern for the robot to follow.
> Please state why this pattern is energy efficient.

> The robot's current "Drive-until-Hit-then-Random-Turn" pattern is energy efficient for reaction and survival because it minimizes energy spent on decision-making and steering.
>
> To efficiently cover a rectangular area, the robot must follow a planned path called the Boustrophedon (or "Lawnmower") pattern. This pattern is designed for maximum coverage with minimal travel distance. It basically drives in a straight line, moves an equal distance to the robot's length, drives in a straight line, etc.
